		<h3>Our Story</h3>
		<h4>Our Company Elders</h4>
		<p>Grapevine started in 2010 based on the desire to help companies manage and stay aware of online reviews. Erik Larson and Richard Ortega both came from industries painfully aware of the impact and importance of reviews. Richard, a die-hard "foodie", hails from the hospitality industry and Erik, a fanatical Dallas Cowbowys fan since befoer their last championship, came from the auto dealiship sector.  Josh Seltzer, whom has has never lost a video gmae match gracefully, joined the team as a partner in 2012 and brings his high energy into the mix with years of front-end development under his belt.  Everyone at Grapevine is passioante about customer satisfaction and creating great software.</p>
