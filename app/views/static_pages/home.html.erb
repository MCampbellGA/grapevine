	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>Every day, people talk about your business online &ndash; sometimes good, sometimes not. If a new review pops up online, you&rsquo;ll get an email alert from us automatically. These emails are easy to read and interact with on desktops, tablets and smart phones.  Downtime should be focused on preparation and managing your business. Don&rsquo;t spend that time searching for reviews by hand &ndash; we deliver them to you!</p>
