Truly a professional. I usually only see that in New York where young men have spent their lives in the service industry. Not too many of the fancy Scottsdale restaurants have this type of service.

I said to myself throughout the evening how impressed I was that Wichita had the talent to pull off a difficult musical like Sweeney Todd. The leads were strong and the ensemble cast was very good. Most of the vocals were truly impressive. I enjoyed every scene and was touched by many of the songs because they were delivered with such strong conviction. The acting was a bit uneven, the leads were obviously seasoned performers and created strong characters, but a few of the actors either over or underacted but their impact was minor in the overall production. The set design was stunningly effective and the stage was used to great advantage. The small orchestra was also very good.

The website stated the restaurant opened at five but when we arrived at 6 p.m. the dinning room was not set and the hostess had to ask permission to seat us because they ""weren't ready"" because of a wedding reception occurring in the adjacent banquet hall.",10/20/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore7/pavilion-restaurant-northbrook,pavilion-restaurant-northbrookPeople Lounge,http://www.opentable.com/people-lounge?scpref=110&tab=2,3.9,"1560 N.

My only complaint is that the plates were a bit overpriced for the portion size. We got only 2 bacon-wrapped dates for $6, which felt a bit of a rip off.
