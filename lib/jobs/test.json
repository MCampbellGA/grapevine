I didn\u0027t even need a knife or scissors to open the package, just fingernails to rip it where it said to cut.","Pros":"I have a Dell OptiPlex GX260 (latest BIOS update was 2005 so that tells you how old it is...it is now June, 2012... lol) that I got for free a few weeks ago.  It had 512MB of PC2100 266MHz ram in it that I *needed* to upgrade.  IDC if it\u0027s $50, it is imperative that I upgrade from 512MB to the maximum (2GB) allowed.  I put in this ram with absolutely no issues.  Opened it up, took out the old, put in the new and the only thing I had to do was at boot-up - to confirm the system configuration changed from 512MB to 2GB.  That was it.  So, if you have a Dell OptiPlex GX260, throw away your current old slow memory and put in this max speed (for your machine) and size memory and enjoy the extreme upgrade it provides.  My machine is my new Free BSD server at home and it welcomes this ram upgrade with open arms.","Comments":"Do not like Newegg\u0027s new free shipping program, where they use the UPS/USPS integration thing.  I ordered a week ago and it\u0027s finally here.  Back in the day, I\u0027d order something and it would be here next day or the day after next.  And free.  My order sat 30 miles away for a few days.  There\u0027s no excuse for that except for the USPS being lazy/underfunded :(  Pay the extra few bucks for fast shipping, the same level that used to be free.","TotalConsented":0,"TotalVoting":0},{"Title":"Didnt work for me","Rating":5,"PublishDate":"5/22/2012 10:03:15 AM","LoginNickName":"KN","BoughtTimeTypeString":"1 day to 1 week","TechLevelTypeString":"Somewhat High","IsNewReview":true,"PurchaseMark":true,"Cons":"none with the memory","Pros":"The SDRAM seemed to work ok, but my mobo had problems with it.","Comments":"After ordering 2 sets of this memory, i found that my mobo didnt work well with it, so i returned both sets. one set got lost in the mail about 2 months ago and it still hasnt been recovered. i guess im out $50","TotalConsented":0,"TotalVoting":0},{"Title":"","Rating":5,"PublishDate":"5/7/2012 1:02:56 PM","LoginNickName":"nice crispy bacon","BoughtTimeTypeString":"more than 1 year","TechLevelTypeString":"Somewhat High","IsNewReview":true,"PurchaseMark":true,"Cons":"nope","Pros":"Owned this RAM for almost 4 years, not a single problem","Comments":"","TotalConsented":0,"TotalVoting":0}],"PaginationInfo":{"TotalCount":411,"PageSize":10,"PageNumber":1,"PageCount":0},"ProductImageInfo":{"Title":null,"FullPath":"http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/20-145-579-TS?$S300W$","ThumbnailImagePath":null,"SmallImagePath":null,"PathSize35":null,"PathSize60":null,"PathSize100":null,"PathSize125":null,"PathSize180":null,"PathSize300":null,"PathSize640":null},"ProductReviewBarInfo":{"RatingCounts":411,"Rating1Count":"26","Rating1Percent":6,"Rating2Count":"15","Rating2Percent":4,"Rating3Count":"15","Rating3Percent":4,"Rating4Count":"43","Rating4Percent":10,"Rating5Count":"312","Rating5Percent":76}}
