A beautiful bar and the girl swinging and hitting the bell are just a part of the fantastic ambience. But what was particularly amazing was the quality of ALL the dishes we tried, not just the steaks! Amazing food at such a reasonable price. Other steak houses charge much more for the steak and all the sides are extra. But OSF provides a salad and your choice of 2 side dishes with your steak...all for less than you would pay just for the steak at other fine steakhouses. We definitely will return to try other dishes. We highly recommend this place without reservation!",07/14/2012
