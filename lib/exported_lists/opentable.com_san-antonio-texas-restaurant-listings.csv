Ácenar,3.8,"146 East Houston San Antonio, TX  78205 ",124,Contemporary Mexican,$30 and under,Downtown,http://www.acenar.com,keith@acenar.com,(210) 222-2362,3.8 / 5,"Love the ambiance! Very groovy, oranges & browns. Right on the RiverWalk, so outside dining would be fun, although we chose to eat indoors.Note to all diners: Ask your server for recommendations - and then TAKE THEM. We asked Jeffrey for his suggestions of menu items that are specific to Ácenar - and there are many to choose from. (No point in ordering a cheese enchilada when there's a duck chalupa on the menu!) He gave us his personal favorites, as well as what other guests have recommended. We were not disappointed. Both my Fish Veracruz & my partner's Pork Tenderloin were outstanding in every way.Jeffrey also hooked us up w/ a jalapeño-based cream salsa that was well worth the $2.95.",07/09/2012
