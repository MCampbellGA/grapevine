Very groovy, oranges & browns. Right on the RiverWalk, so outside dining would be fun, although we chose to eat indoors.Note to all diners: Ask your server for recommendations - and then TAKE THEM. We asked Jeffrey for his suggestions of menu items that are specific to Ácenar - and there are many to choose from. (No point in ordering a cheese enchilada when there's a duck chalupa on the menu!) He gave us his personal favorites, as well as what other guests have recommended. We were not disappointed. Both my Fish Veracruz & my partner's Pork Tenderloin were outstanding in every way.Jeffrey also hooked us up w/ a jalapeño-based cream salsa that was well worth the $2.95.",07/09/2012

Alas, the girls didn't like it. But when the waitress checked on our meals, she quickly replaced the meals with chicken strips instead, which was really nice. The manager even came over to check on us, which we thought was especially thoughtful considering children are often passed over in restaurants when they don't like their food (because they're kids...and that means picky!) Then he came back once they got the chicken fingers to ask if they were better. It was really appreciated and that alone made the service really stand out. Thanks!",07/04/2012
