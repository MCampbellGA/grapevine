review description,="My husband and I enjoyed a lovely dinner on a Saturday night. While the restaurant wasn't very busy, the food was wonderful and the ambiance was romantic. It a great spot to enjoy a quiet, romantic dinner.","Great wait staff and great food. If u are expecting to enjoy your food, this is the place. Quantity is just righ. Highly impressed","Bring a flashlight--so dark can barely see menu or food- should've been our 1st clue! My birthday on Tues evening told on reservation-we were only table! Ordered Osso Bucco--but they didnt' have any of it or Saltimbocca. Was told the lobster tail was only 2-3 oz so no point there. Got the ravioli---there was no oxtail ragu that I could see- very bland (no salt/pepper on table) with very little & filling. Sent it back & ordered Chicken Marengo w/Shrimp, Scallops & Crabmeat--was way too salty-my husband uses a LOT of salt & even said it was over salted (we guessed they were making up for bland dish before). I sent it back & ate nothing-I usually don't do that. He ordered the pork chops which was okay. Too expensive--especially for bland food.",We put on the reservation notes that we were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a piece of cake complimentary without us having to tell them at the restaurant.,Food was outstanding as well as the wine list. Only concern was that our waiter was not knowledgable of the menu items or the wine list. We were basically on our own. He was very nervous when asked any questions.,I had to take the lamb home and feed the bloodhound.,"Great dinner on their outdoor patio. Waiter was excellent and checked in on us just the right amount. Food was outstanding, and very authentically italian. Loved everything about this place!",Always a pleasure to dine here.,"We had the Chef's menu with wine pairing and we felt service could have been much better considering the money we were spending. The person dropping off the food talked way too fast and was in a rush to leave at every course. I understand it was a very busy night, but service should have been a little bit better. It wasn't bad service, but it definitely wasn't what I expected it should be. The food made up for the lack of service.","We picked this restaurant for its convenience when attending a play at the Hobby Center. For just that alone it was perfect! But then came the fabulous food, fantastic service and fun atmosphere! It is a ten out of ten!","One of my favorite restaurants. Our guests and my husband and I have always had a good experience when we dine at Arturos. We just took my step-son and his wife for the second time and he sighed during his meal and said ""I just really like this restaurant"".","We went for a special birthday celebration for my husband with daughter and late teen grandson. The table was lovely and conversation was easy to hear each other. The waiter was not knowledgable on wine, but we ended up from our own experience w/ a very nice Graves. Everyone loved their salads, entrees (3 had fish which they loved--I had seafood risotto--the seafood was a little over cooked & salty, but OK). We shared 3 different desserts, which were all outstanding.","I can't say enough good things about this visit. My boyfriend and I have always enjoyed dining here, but this dinner was the best. Due to traffic, we arrived late, and now we were going to be rushed to dine before our play started. The hostess was kind enough to seat us promptly near the door, and our waiter David made suggestions to help us pick a quick meal. David also got drinks and the bill to us quickly to help expedite the process. He was wonderful about making sure we had a great time at dinner, but still left us time to walk to the Alley. I look forward to returning soon, but this time for a more relaxed dining experience. Thanks for saving the evening!",Never disappointed! Try the crazy Irishman role! The samplers off the hot appetizer section are delish!,Disappointed with the fried tofu (appetizer) but everything else was excellent (as always). Service has been consistently good lately.,Liked the whole experience. Will be back.,"Benihana used to be one of my favorite places to go as a kid and I enjoyed taking my daughter there, but the place looks SO DATED! It really needs to be upgraded and improved. Also, I remember these big flares of flame and better presentation than was available on our night. Food was good, but think other Japanese steak houses / hibachi grills have improved on the Benihana experience.",i love this place send me more coupons :-),"Food was ok. I ordered the delux. The lobster and steak. Lobster was over cooked and steak was dry. Not impressed by food. Also, the waiter forgot a few drink ordersa. Wich took forever to correct. I wish this place had some better skilled people. They were nice, but not impressed",This is one of our favorite restaurants in town! There seasonal menus offers something unique and always perfectly prepared. Portion sizes are just right and feels like you should be paying more! Love it before a play!,"Good food and great service, but the parking situation was abysmal!! Took forever just to get into the lot and have the valet take the car. Then, they had to track us down inside to say we didn't leave a key (despite the fact that the valet was driving away in the car as we were walking into the restaurant). We reminded them that the car had a push-button ignition and a smart key which was IN THE CAR. Then when we got ready to leave, we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the car. They did give us a complimentary chocolate cake because of the car issue, but it was pure torture for me, since I'm on a very low-carb diet. They didn't need to do anything to make it up to us, but we would have preferred to have just gotten a small credit o",I did not feel like the table server really knew the menu.She did not know the ingredients on the luncheon menu.She did not interact well with the ladies at the table.I said this was a special occassion and it was not even mentioned.I wrotethis on the reservation but like I said it was not mentioned. Any one mentioning thebirthday would have been nice. I am not sure we had the best view in the restaurant andthere were not only 2 other tables being used in the restaurant. I would ratherhave faced the gulf thana parking lot.,"Food was fresh, delicious, and imaganitive. Wine list was excellent and reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend.","Great food and service, as always.","Excellent Sunday Brunch at a very reasonable price. It was advertized as a jazz brunch so I expected live music but was disappointed, although the piped music was quite nice.","The food was excellent and prepared perfectly. The filet was tender, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The duck breast was outstanding. The macaroni and cheese was disappointing, though.",Great to be able to bring in your own wine or choose from a nice wine list,"Classic restaurant in the Houston theater district, part of a boutique hotel. Dining room reminds one of a small restaurant in London. We have been going there for many years in conjunction with Alley Theatre performances.","I would wager that anyone who has posted a favorable review for Blackfinn also has The Olive Garden as one of their favorites. Once you open the menu, you can tell: from Sysco food trucks to your table. Not bad food, but in no ""way fit for foodies"".Bachelorette party location, high school dinner date option, or lunch with you coworkers - all appropriate here.","All the food was really good & our server (Monica) was lovely. Great wine knowledge. Beef, grits, and mustard greens all delicious & portion size was great. Only two minor complaints. Appetizer needed salt & none on table. Entree was dropped on table by someone other than server while I still had 3/4's of appetizer to eat. Would certainly recommend/ go back.","- Though I rescheduled the reservation time thrice they were courteous and did comply- The veg pad thai was made in fish oil, after emphasizing that fish oil is not veggie in our consideration they made a special veg dish- The floor opened for dancing and it was fun too- We were there to celebrate our friend's b'day and we did so, she had a blast",Excellent service and friendly to those who are not sushi connoisseurs. Great date spot.,we go to bluefish regularly. atmosphere is good and we love the volcano rolls.,"ERarly evening dinner. The buffet was outstanding with great prime rib, seafood, etc. Waiter very attentive and helpful. Wonderful view of the Port turning basin, tugs, cargo ships and barges.",Best part of the meal was the salad and dessert. Entrees were good but not great. Wine was overpriced - very few selections under $50.,Wow!!!! My husband and I went there to celebrate our anniversary and had a wonderful dining experience. All the staff were wonderful. The food was exceptional along with their enormous inventory of delicious wines. We can't wait to go back!!!!!,"Brasserie Max and Julie was impeccable. We arrived on a Sunday about 5-10 minutes before opening time, but they let us (and the couple in front of us) in, sat us and gave us water (tap in bottles just like France) and menus to peruse. We were there for Sunday brunch and it was our first time at the restaurant so we kept our choices safe. The onion soup is perfect and the crepes are light and delicious with many offered toppings. I enjoyed the nutella crepe for dessert while my mother had a savory crepe for breakfast. My husband stuck with the waffle and jambon de paris. Everything that came out was great and the service was brilliant. We will definitely be returning.",As always a wonderful dinner. Brennans never fails to please.,I and my now fiancee went to Brenner's for my proposal to her. The staff was notified and took care of everything in an incredibly classy way,"If you want a quite romantic place to celebrate a special occasion, i.e. anniversary etc. this is not the place. The noise level is off the charts. We had a hard time conversing across a table for two.","Excellent service, food & atmosphere! I very highly recommend Bucca di Beppo to everyone!! We were celebrating our wedding with dinner at Bucca ... the staff made our experience on of the best we've ever had!!",Half our order was delivered 20 minutes after the first was delivered. I actually had to ask for the rest of the order. Service was terrible.,"Brookwood is a gem. Staff / service is outstanding. The food is delicious with great presentation. The environment is peaceful and beautiful. The cafe is outstanding, the gift shop has something for everyone, and the gardens / plants are fabulous. Everyone I have taken to Brookwood say it was so much more than they imagined. A truly wonderful experience. Bring your camera! Hats off to Brookwood for not only a consistently great job but what an outstanding commitment to society and their community!",Had a large group for dinner and it was quiet enough to carry on a conversation.Food was diverse and good. Everyone had a great time.,"I don't know why there were so few people in there. At first we were a little hesitant to go in since it appeared empty. It was about 8 PM so it was a little past the busier time. The food was DELICIOUS, the wait staff attentive but not cloying. The live music was beautiful. I would definately recommend it to someone for a romantic night out.",A great place for a girlfriend catch up visit. Quiet and fun food/,Food was terrible! Especially the bread or fried dishes like dumplings and pancakes to moo shoo pork. Also very little shrimp or chicken in main dishes,ALways an outstanding meal cooked to perfection. And the Lobster mac and cheese was unbelievable.,I had the seabass for lunch and it was delicious. Very fresh and the tomato sauce that it was served with was really good. I wouldn't definitely got there again.,"Nice atmosphere, nice music (not overwhelming so you could appreciate it), very pleasant place to attend with friends.The parking lot was crammed, which you can expect on a Saturday evening, but the table was ready on time, the reservation was properly managed and we could linger at the end of the dinner without feeling pushed out.One important thing: prima il dolce, e soltanto dopo il caff̬ !","Great off-the-menu options for appetizers and entrees. Nice ambiance. Attentive wait staff. Fresh vegetables, especially the mushrooms!",Love. Love. Love Chez Nous! We have never been disappointed!,"Food wasn't bad, but wasn't special either. Also took alot longer than we were expecting.",Wow! What a wonderful meal! Everything about it was superb!,"The noise level was so high as to be almost disqualifying. Conversation was almost impossible. Isn't there a better euphemism for ""outrageously noisy"" than ""energetic""?",What a great place!! We'll be back.,"We love Churrascos, and this was our second time to the Sugar Land location. We came to celebrate a birthday. The waitstaff was exceptional, and the location and view were outstanding. This is a perfect spot for small groups, as well as large. Our group ordered fish and steaks, and everyone was delighted with their meals. Thank you for making this a special occasion for all.","Our group enjoyed our meal. 2 ordered the Chicken Osso Bucco, a special for the evening. One a fish dish and one a pasta dish. The pasta & meat sauce (can't spell bolognese) was a bit salty but tasty. The chicken was very tasty but not a lot of it. The fish received good reviews. The service was excellent.",Excellent paella! Great sangria. Most tapas were well prepared but flavor profiles were a bit simplistic.,"Definitely try the Spaghetti Pomodoro! We sat in the wine room in the back of the restaurant and enjoyed it tremendously. The flavor was there, not overly salty, not overly oily, just the right amount of seasoning and good ingredients.","We have always liked Crappitos,however after bringing two couples there for dinner recently, we were very disappointed. We went on a Wednesday evening and even though we were one of just a few tables in the entire place, it took forever to get our food. My martini was made incorrectly and one of the dishes ordered was incorrect as well.The food was mediocre. Don't know if there was a different cook, but we were disappointed.","We waited 15 minutes before our server showed her face. We shared the Chicken Yakitori which came with 4 skewers--was good & actually perfect amount. Husband had the Crave hibachi-filet mignon plate--he had 4 strips of beef about 2 inches long about 1/2 inch wide, 1/4 inch thick---about 2 tbsp of veggies & a very small scoop of rice. I had the salmon ceviche which was okay & Hamachi sushi & 2 other kinds which were small as well & I can't remember what kind they were as they were only so-so as I have had better. Service was poor & I didn't understand that as our server only had 1 other table beside us--we went on a Wednesday night & there was only about 10 other customers there. We won't be back--over priced for sub-par food & bad service.",I loved everything about the House of Blues experience. I dis noy like the parking situation but that is no fault of HOB. Everything on the menu is responsibly priced and I had the best burger ever. I will come again.,"Everything was great! I said kid friendly but I was there during the week. If the same little girl would have been running around making noise on the weekend I would have been a little less forgiving. Hopefully the parents would not allow that. Service was good, food was great and the price was fitting.","Our second time at DaMarco - creatures of habit that we are, our wine selection and entree were the same as previous, except the Steak Florentine for two had been elevated to an even higher grade cut of beef. Exceptional, but that uplift in the cut of meat raised the price of an already pricey dish by over 50%. It was worth it, but we'll definitely be students of the remainder of the menu next time.",Very relaxing atmosphere! Pleasant experience.,"Our European guest provided the best compliment about Damian's...she said it made her feel like she was back home. Wonderful food, great wine and a nice quiet atmosphere!",everything was wonderful. food was great and we had a very attentive waiter,"This is a superb venue for a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary. Everything is first class and yet the restaurant is cozy once seated. Food is excellent and nicely priced. Service is top notch and personalized, starting with the hostess greeting you by name and then the same for the server (who is also very knowledgeable about the wines, foods, and specials).","Excellent all around.....fantastic seafood choices (both regular-on-the-menu and specials), perfectly prepared with a great selection of sides. The truffle mac and cheese and sauteed spinich were diabolical. Would highly recommend.","Could up the quality of the bar options, food was great!",Eric's is great place to dine before taking in a concert or play at the University of Houston.,"The staff was outstanding as usual...hostesses, wait staff, are bartenders are all exceptional. We had a great time.","Excellent host, excellent food, excellent wait staff and excellent visit. as usual.",consistent - never disappointsFriendy waitstaff & great food,We enjoyed a wonderful meal as usual!,"Had the veal parm and it was the best I've had in a very long time. Very tender veal with an excellent crusting. My buddy had a roasted chicken dish and his only comment was he'll be back again for the same. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Barbara, the owner, stopped by to thank us for coming; I thought that was very classy. This is a great place to have lunch and we'll be back.","The last time we ate at Gaido's was more than a let down. This time was superb. Our waitress, Katya, was very attentive and made the experience five-star worthy. Way to bounce back, Gaido's. I will recommend you again.","We were a little nervous about our choice of eateries upon entering from the lack-luster Westheimer entrance. The outdoor seating area is not taken care of and the actual door is not obvious. The bar area could use a little face-lift love as well. The main dining area is pretty, decorated with hanging cherry blossom branches. Even though the decor was stimulating, we couldn't get past being able to see out into the mall, which took away from our overall experience. Our waiter was very attentive and promptly served our food. The calamari was perfectly crispy and the cocktails were delicious. The entrees were also very tasty and served steaming hot. 9/10 for food - 10/10 for service. Did not meet our expectations for atmosphere.","Food was fantastic! I rated the service 3 stars because we were double charged on our credit card and we are still waiting on an adjustment. Other than that, it's definitely worth a visit.",Food tasted great. We ordered grilled shrimp and grilled chicken and enjoyed it very much. We even stayed for the entertainment and danced the night away. Haven't done that in a long time. Will definitely look for this band again when they return to our area. So fun!,Food was very good but bad location. Hard to get into the parking lot and limited parking. Valet was overwhelmed. Inside it was very crowded with tables too close to each other and so loud I had a hard time conducting my business lunch.,"I was really impressed when I recently visited The Grove. This restaurant was recommended to me by my best friend, and since this was my first visit I really didn't know what to expect. I brought my fianc̩e here to celebrate her most recent accomplishment in her career, needless to say she was VERY impressed! The Grove has great ambiance, food, exceptional customer service and it's a very romantic place with a wonderful view of the city. I'll definitely be back and I would recommend it to others as well!!!","A year ago, I would have highly recommended this place. As a matter of fact, I took some friends there because of the experience we had previously. But this time was not nearly the experience we had in the past. We made a reservation and we still had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for a table. While well flavored, most of the steak was dry. The parmesean pork and sausage is still excellent though. The waiter was nice, but long stretches of time would pass between the servers visits to the table. My husband and I left feeling that we would not return.","The food was actually very good. However, the dishes we ordered were very salty. I would go back and try it again and ask that they use less salt. Otherwise, I nice experience.",Excellent ambiance in a beautiful historic building. Food portions are smaller but so is the price. Great food and service.,Amazing food! Would come here all the time if i lived close by.,Try the soft shell crab....delicious,Everything was great! including Brian bringing my Credit Card all the way to our Hotel after closing.They all go the extra mile! Kudos!!!,Best restaurant I have ever been to and I have been to some great restaurants.,"The wine was wonderful, new menu items devine, we will be back each month for Wine and Dine.","Very affordable, and our favorites tasted just as we remembered them from our last trip to Jamaica. Restaurant was casual and comfortable. The sweet potato fries are FANTASTIC.",Why do I wait to be seated when I have reservations,The food was just okay but overpriced. The service is extremely slow. We went on a Thursday. There was only one other couple when we arrived. We sat for about 10 minutes until we were finally able to flag someone to take our drink order.,"An excellent meal - the salmon and watermelon was as good and as creative as anything at Uchi, the smoked duck salad is becoming a favourite of ours and the signature rolls were perfection.","Katsuya is very expensive; for the prices I would rather go to Uchi's for the uniqueness and better service. Food was good not great, drinks are expensive $14 but the most disturbing part of the bill was the charge of $16 for water-really? We were asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water - I said flat thinking it would be tap. If we are going to be charged that much for water I feel the waiter should have said it is artisian or Fuji water that is $8 per bottle. The water was put in a glass carafe in an ice bucket. I thought they were keeping the water cold since it is an expensive restaurant. Sadly I won't return as I feel like I was taken advantage and would prefer to give my money to other upscale sushi restaurants such as Uchi.",Best dry-aged steaks in the Houston area.,We always enjoy the food and dining experience at one of our top Houston restaurants.,"From the moment of arrival to departure, the smell of smoke from the bar was very unpleasant and unappetizing.","I got a call an hour before the reservation to confirm the lunch and for the # of vegetarian menus required as I had requested in my reservation. This just set the tone of the excellent service that was to follow. The server kept on checking on us every few minutes for beverages/food. Food was served v fast and the group enjoyed their entrees. One of them had requested an egg salad and when the plates were being removed mentioned a few pieces of egg shells being present. The server was v apologetic and within a few minutes wrote off the salad from the bill. Shortly thereafter, the manager showed up, apologized, explained how they use fresh eggs, and made amends immediately with a huge cake! Kona won everyone over in our group!",The wine list was excellent and very reasonable priced. The presentation of the food was lovely and everything was delicious. Our waiter was very attentive. We would definitely go back and recommend Kris Bistro.,"Went for brunch. Not very much information out there about their brunch, except that it is good. It would be nice if they put information on their website. Apparently, they change the items as lunch time gets closer. I thought that this would be a ""mexican food"" buffet. It was normal breakfast items with a couple of omlet stations and a few mexican specialties. I probably will not go back or if I do, it will be later in the morning.",Excellent staff and very personable. Can not wait to return.,"Food is always good. I often will have wine by the glass (wife does not drink) and they served my wine at the right temperature (i.e. cooler than ""room temperature"") which is something I don't see nearly often enough.",The food and service were great. Our waitress was funny and hospitable. She served great Margaritas!,The food was cooked perfectly and correct as ordered. The wait was short as well - perfect night out!,"Las Alamedas always delights the senses with exceptional food, great wines and excellent service. They continue the fine tradition established in the Memorial area and it is now a pleasure to dine with them in our local neighborhood!",The food was very good. The margaritas were exceptional.,We had a very nice dinner. Service was great. Owner or mgr. (not sure) came around & was so friendly.,"Outstanding service and the food is also superb! The Prime Rib is some of the best I've had- Sat at the bar for a bit and had a great time- Case, the Bartender , offered great service and conversation. Laurenzo's has become my Wife's and I new ""spot""!","We've been a few times---keeps getting worse and worse. This will be our last. We're pretty sure this hotel and restaurant are now just used for some kind of money laundering. They are constantly [extensively] remodeling the hotel and never seem to have all that many guests. They honestly don't seem to care about the restaurant at all. The food was all microwaved, but they might have used a toaster oven for the fries and fried catfish....the service was inattentive at best, it was really comical. There were only 3 tables and 5 service staff standing around and we waited forever. Such a beautiful space--it should be packed....but again, they don't seem to care if they have people in there or not.....something shady is going on there","We love this restaurant but this night it was not so great - there was a rehersal dinner in the main dining so our table was in the bar which is fine - we like to eat in there. We had escargot to start - it was not really hot enough. The calamari was excellent. salads were not really cold and sort of wilted even, but my son loved his. I had veal picatta but it was just not up to the usual - no capers even. I am guessing the kitchen was strained with the large group in the rehersal dinner. Also - our waitress was very sweet but not great at clearing the table of finished dishes. We loved the live music as usual. I don't usually complain - and we will be back but if it is like this again then probably not after that.","Emjoyed service, food and music. So fortunate weather allowed us outside which was special treat.",We went there for our anniversary and it was very romantic. There was live music and our waiter was wonderful. We just moved to College Station and were happy to find a nice place to go for our celebration.,"As ALWAYS, LYNN'S STEAKHOUSE is head & shoulders above ANY Houston restaurant!",Fried asparagus is our favorite. We were made aware of this resturant through Open Table.com and are returning customers.,Celebrated my 55th Bday with some friends. Had a wonerful time . Food was fabulous. Thanks for the $10. off coupon. We will be back.,We loved it! Great food and awesome outdoor patio. Tapas were outstanding and we had a good spanish wine recommended by the waiter. We will be back!,I had a wonderful lunch there with a coworker and look forward to many more!,"I found my filet to be nothing memorable, and the risotto had large chunks of herbs with the stems still on making it hard and unpleasant to eat - felt like I was eating grass with my meal. Also at least one gnat was flying around our table for the entire meal - ugh. There was no delay at all between courses. Some might like this but I felt we were rushed out the door since we were the first seating of the night. Others at the table loved their entrees - swordfish and bison ribeye were very good.","I had been wanting to go to Max's for some time to try their fried chicken. I finally made it. All 4 of us ordered the same dish - fried chicken. It looked so good on the plate. One bite in - no seasoning on the batter, no seasoning in the meat. It did not appear that the meat was brined. I was so disappointed. I might go back to try their pancakes. They looked and smelled good. The service was fine - not too friendly, but just fine for a late night crowd.",the sandia gazpacho was why we camewe usually eat at the T&C locationit was good,Attended business lunch at restaurant. Was quiet enough to be able to talk freely. Lashonda (our waitstaff) didn't hover and was very gracious with limited interruptions when she noticed that we were discussing business.,We had our daughter's 18th birthday party. They bent over backwards to make her evening special. The food and service we excellent.,Food was wonderful had the best table in the bar. and the singer on Saturday was delightful. We had a great evening.,Would request a table in the main dining room . Noise level and ambiance are issues if seated in the secondary room.,"I was at the restaurant with a group of friends and talking was our main objective. Speed of service was a little slow, but we enjoyed the evening.",I would totally recommend the Monarch to anyone that wants to a great place for any occasion.,Although the food and service was good - it was way over-priced. Dinner for 2 was equal to a dinner for 4 the night before at Taste of Texas - and much better food at Taste of Texas.,"We loved the atmosphere; moderately quiet,not distracting; The steak was just right, tender, succulent, and just enough for out pallet; spinach salad was great, and the dessert, chocolate mousse, carrot cake was outstanding; the service was spectacular; what a great dining experience; will be coming back soon.","Its one of Houstons best kept secrets, the Somelier is wonderful and has great knowledge of wines. Crab cakes and Tuna was delicious ........ Cant wait to go back","Yum, yum, yum!!! As an Italian American I don't typically eat Italian food out at restaurants, but the meal I had a Napoli was authentic and delicious! I have been to Houston twice, and have enjoyed two meals at this restaurant.","The best tortillas I have ever tasted! Excellent range of menu items and great atmosphere for TEX MEX dining. I drive 60 miles round trip once a week for their ""India""(large fried flower tortilla topped with beans,cheese,shrimp, chicken or beef fajita meat, lettuce, and pico) corn tortilla's and spicy carrots.",Had a really great dinner fob was superb! Best kept secret in Houston.,"Although we've been here a few times, and the food and service are always very good, this recent visit was a surprise in terms of the number of families and children. As a result, it was a bit noisier than we prefer.",This is a resturant that my wife and I have gone to several times for our own dining. I was confident that it would be good for a business lunch. I was wrong.,FIRST TIME DINING THERE. Had a party if nine. Not sure if waiting over one hour for food her is the norm. I had shrimp sandwich and fruit. sandwich was good and fruit fresh.,Great food and wonderful service!,"Out for a special dinner with our 15 year old. Food was good and our server was terrific! there were two large parties in the area we were seated, so sometime a bit louder than was comfortable.",Great food and service for an old style steak house. A bit on the pricey side but OK with the $50 coupon and for a change.,"Simply the best in Houston. From steaks to sides to desert, it is hard to beat Pappas.","Great service,unique and delicious food. Chef Paul is very friendly and hospitable. He visits with guests tableside and makes you feel really appreciated as a patron!",Perry's Italian is always a great occasion!,Always an enjoyable experience - without a doubt the best steakhouse in the Champions area.,The 4 for 4 was a great offer. It showcases one of the finest restaurants in out area that which we were unaware.,"Food was excellent but it was a little more pricy than I expected. Entrees (we ordered) were in the $45 price range and everything else (salads, side dishes) was separately priced and around $8 each.",Food good. We all enjoyed our meals.,"Perry's was a great experience! The service was excellent. Augustine was courteous and friendly during the whole meal and made my wife's birthday dinner a special experience. Not to mention the table-side carved pork, which is the best pork dish I've ever tasted. If you want a nice steakhouse experience, I highly recommend Perry's.",This was for our anniversary amd they made it very special.,Very interesting menu and not the average fare. new twists on standard dishes,Juan our waiter was fabulous handling our big group. Many thanks.,"Imagine the night before the AVON Walk - Houston. 8 women ( 4 from the Chicago area coming just to walk Houston) getting ready to walk a total of 39.3 miles in two days for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research... Anxious.. Hungry... ready for a bottle of Chianti. Needing to ""Carbo load!"" ... our environment was wonderful, relaxed... sitting off in the private room... laughing, crying... enjoying the comradarie and companionship.. before the big day... after being sufficiently satisfied gastrononically : ) and emotionally we had bid farewell to the our wonderful wait staff and our kind and gracious host, Mr. M. Retzafflt!","I went to Piola with a friend who wanted pizza. Since we were both from New Jersey where good pizza is not hard to find, we were surprised by the quality of the crust and the flavor of the pizza at Piola. We did not think that we could find such good pizza in Houston. I highly recommend Piola for anyone who wants pizza while they are in Houston.","The food, service, ambiance and wine were excellant.","Found this place on the net looking for BYOB places in houston.Booked reservation on line (though none is required) and it was super simple.Sat on the patio. Had dinner and wine we brought. Really anjoyed the breeze and greenery was between us and street so allowed us to have view of the people watching on Washington Ave,and a break from it at same time. Railing was lit with small white lights, nice ambiance.Food was plentiful, well cooked, service was Excellent, and we found it relaxing. Indoor seemed nice too, would try it if patio full or inclement weather. Staff was friendly and relaxed, good customer focus without pretentiousness. VERY reasonable prices for the amount of food. Food was high quality.Would definately go back.","I like Post Oak Grill for business lunches. It's very convenient, quick service and good food.",The sea bass was spectacular. It was served over a bed of cabbage in a delicious broth with other veggies around it. The cheese bisquits were served warm and often and were yummy. Service was great from Ken. Highly recommend the restaurant!,The staff was very attentive. The food was very good. I especially enjoyed the hot food and salad buffet that came with the Rodizio meal. The grilled meats were comparable to other well known churrascaria type restaurants that are more expensive.,"We went for Easter Sunday Brunch and had expected a wide variety of food including ham, fresh vegetables, and many desserts. Everything we ate was decent, but just not the selection we anticipated.",The mixoligist started the night right with the best Old Fashion I have ever had. The appetizer of homemade potato chips was tremdous. The shrimp and grits were great. Didn't have room for desert but looking forward to going back and try it.,We had a great evening at Quattro from drinks before dinner at the bar all the way through the wonderful meal. Fantastic service and amazing food.,"Having gluten-free items made it easier to accomodate all in our party. Excellent gumbo, excellent duck entree and bread pudding to die for.","I had visited Rattan once a few years ago for dinner and thought it overpriced, but returned with a group from work for lunch to try it again. The restaurant space is light and bright, and the service was OK, but the kitchen was very slow causing our lunch to run too long. The waiters did not offer us the lunch special menu, someone who was aware of it had to ask for it. We were offered an appetizer platter and made the mistake of saying ""yes"" without asking about the price: $48!!! The food was quite good but there are other good options for Asian food not far away that are a better value.","Awesome fresh produce, grass fed beef and ambiance!","A little pricey for what you get, but overall, a nice experience.","Buffet style food was edible, but it is obvious the prices are charged based on the captive basketball audience rather than the quality of the food. The fish was especially dry and overcooked (even when the fish came directly from the kitchen).","The portion sizes were on the small side in relation to the prices. But overall, it was a nice meal.","The Remington has always been a favorite eatery for me. The wait staff is superb as is the presentation of the food. If you have a special dietary need, they will accomodate.","I had dinner when it changed to Royal Sonesta, great service, great food,","Overall, we enjoyed our evening at Rio Ranch Steakhouse.","It is my second visit to the restaurant. Again I was very pleased with the food and especially the service. The sommelier was great, he suggested a great wine for our dinner. The restaurant manager,the captain and the staff was awsome, the chef came to my table and explained us the food.Will be back soon. I can not wait.","This is an ambitious and creative project, so we are not too concerned that it has not yet fully hit its stride. In our recent visit, the vegetable dishes were impeccable, one of the two entree dishes were outstanding and both desserts that we shared were sublime. The service is a bit spotty, but friendly and clearly trying hard. Definitely worth a return visit.",We had a wonderful time at Rudy and Paco! Definitely going back soon. This was our (my husband and I) first time there ever. Our server Katy was very kind and helpful. She guided us through selecting a wine and our dinners. Wonderful experience cannot wait to go back!,"Marco, our waiter, did an outstanding job. We will request his services on our next visit.",We were able to get a reservation at the last minute and had no problems getting seated and the food was great. It's a great spot down by the Strand to walk around before or after you eat.,A true neighborhood gem! The food is fabulous and service is great. I really like the cozy feel of the restaurant.,"Though we had a very nice evening, the food was unexceptional, and though the staff was attentive, there was a 10-15 minute wait for the fourth person in our group to receive her entree. The snapper (locally available) was skimpy, and not prepared the way it was ordered. Veal chop was good, but do to the delay in serving, the other dishes were getting cold while waiting. This would have been more tolerable if the server would have explained the wait. All in all, the fault was most probably with the kitchen and their timing.","Excellent, the service and food OUTSTANDING!",We took our 3 kids and celebrated Father's Day here. It was a very nice experience -- great view of the Apple Store and the busy retail area below. The service was outstanding and very accommodating to our children's desires. I would definately eat there again and can see how this would be come an annual tradition for Father's Day.,"I like SOMA, but the sushi was dry this visit. Just not as fresh as it should have been. The green tea ice cream was delicious.",My wife and I will definitely be going back. Great experience all around!,First time to eat at the restaurant. Absolutely loved the fresh baked bread and baked garlic! Steak for special was not my favorite. Would try again with new entree.,Nice addition to the dining choices of Kingwood.Oso Bucco ravioli is excellent! Wonderful service.,"It was my birthday and I received a call from Spencer's to ask I'd I would like a private dining area which was very thoughtful. The service was fantastic, we had an appetizer, dinner and drinks served in less than an hour. The food was divine. We had the crab cakes, filet mignon, and the New York strip steak and the food was cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was quiet and romantic. We live in Houston, but plan to spend the night at the hotel and enjoy another lovely dinner real soon.","My wife and I really enjoyed our wedding anniversary dinner at Spindletop. This was our first time at Spindletop and had a great experience, the service, food and view were great.",Very noisy; hard to hear my companion's voice from across the table. Main courses were served when we had only half-finished our appetizers ! Food itself was excellent.,I love this place! The food is delicious and service couldn't be better? Prices are reasonable and it's become our favorite place to dine.,The food is delicious. The atmosphere is very romantic. Great place to take a loved one for a special occassion!,"I give it one star. The server did well until the food arrived, then he made himself scarce. Concerning the food, I can cook better than what we were served. Both my wife and I received cold vegetables. My chicken was dry, along with the side of crawfish risotto. She ordered the lamb. It was cooked medium rare, but it was not seasoned at all. The meat on both of our plates were also not warm enough. To top that off they are way over priced for the small portions that are received.The only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambiance. I would definately not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",The music was so loud we could not hear each other or our waiter. Food was overpriced and absolutely horrible. Our server brought my meal 10-15 minutes before bringing my husband's. The place was empty (at 7 pm on a Friday) so there was really no reason for bad service. Two thumbs down!,This restaurant is amazing. The service is very friendly and attentive. There were 7 of us in our group and we all ordered something different to share. We were all pleased with our dishes and will definitely return. The owner Dawn came by to check on us a couple of times to make sure everything was up to our standards. We all left extremely happy and with plenty of leftover. The portions are huge and very reasonable. They even served us a free dessert with out entree. You don't see much of that anymore. Give it a try. YOU WILL LOVE IT.,"I attend a math conference in Houston every three years and always go to t'afia, origninally recommended to me by foodies here in Portland OR. Never disappointed! We are a mixed crowd of eaters and everyone always leaves happy. Most surprised are the NW and CA wine aficionados who are always amazed Texas can make fine wines!",outstanding service with delicious food. Moderately pricy but well worth it. the Tango dancers on saturday certainly add to the South American ambiance.if there is any negative is the lack of any kid sized portions.,What a find. I had planned on going inside the loop for a celerbration dinner when I heard about Tapas Capriccio through Open Table and decided to try it out. The food was wonderful. There were five of us so we all tried different dishes and traded tastes of everything. All the dishes were favored differently and deliciously. I hate going to a restaurant and all the dishes taste the same. If driving in town is getting up down then try Tapas Capriccio for another reason to stay in the suburbs.,"If you want to just sit and enjoy a quiet riverside evening in greater Houston, this is the place. A shared bottle of wine and some snacks, or a complete meal. Can't beat the view or ambiance. There are a couple of excellent formal restaurants next door, this is my pick for a quiet romantic evening",Surprisingly good lunch - great for business meetings. Food was superb.,"This is just not my kind of ""mexican restaurant"". I really wanted to like it because it is walking distance from my house. It's just kind of odd & I think they pride themselves in this fact. Small & quirky. I'll bet there are people who are Tila's lovers as I am not.",waiting staff was extremely helpfu with wine and food selection.,Excellent experience with friends from out of town!,Excellent food and my husband enjoyed the place.,Food was very good and the waiter was excellent. After dinner we moved over to the bar. I only wish the bartender had been as attentive as our waiter. He should be reminded that his tip depends on good service - not indifferent service.,"Repeat customer, but thats for a reason. Great, friendly service! Impeccable at that! Food was delish..if you eat meat, then you must go NOW","We went to Tradicao for a family special event. We loved the whole experience, the food was excellent, the wine tasted great and the atmosphere - very friendly. Will definitely visit again.","The food was exquisite, well though out, and beautifully presented. The service was impeccable. Best service I've ever had! Been to many upscale restaurants, but the service here was incomparable. It was truly a dining experience.","We have been several times and service has been great (we went early), but this last time the service was really slow due to the fact that they service the wine bar across the parking lot. They utilize the servers and the kitchen to supply the wine bar which slows down the service at the restaurant, so go early if you want good service.",We enjoyed a phenomenal tasting journey at the bar where we watched beautiful composed dishes being created. The staff is very skillful and knowledgeable. Great night out.,"fantastic food, service, look. hope to enjoy this treasure again and again.",The sushi is so fresh. The food is outstanding!,"surprisingly tasty ,well prepared food and good service . Decent wine list. very busy and very noisy","Been here several times, and service and food are consistently top notch.","I was impressed when I got a call back to confirm our reservations-a birthday celebration-and to make sure we were seated where we wanted to sit. In our converstion we discussed seating options and finally determined that a booth was best and available. I confirmed my birthday and was very impressed with the whole, ""we are here to make you happy,"" thing. I even told my husband how impressed I was. When we got there, we were NOT seated in a booth as we had determined earlier on the phone, AND the dessert plate said, ""happy anniversary!"" Really?! I am stunned that after all that, the seating and the dessert were messed up. All that time on perfection and still getting it wrong. A 1st in all my 53 years-specially after confirming!","Very creative food, and a unique modern decor.","What an absolute treasure of a restaurant. The Veranda is a truly local restaurant where the food is incredible, and you get to know the owners personally. My wife and I had just landed at Houston Intercontinental and I used OpenTable to find a good restaurant. Relying on the great reviews, we decided to try the Veranda. I can honestly say that meal became one of our favorite restaurant experiences of all time. The food was among the best we have ever had. The owners, who are musical artists, also interacted with us personally and genuinely. They have had the restaurant at the same location for 16 years. Quaint and excellent. Very reasonable prices. On our list of ""have to go to"" places when in Houston.","A top restaurant for College Station or anywhere! Wonderful food, wine, and service.",I had a great time at this place. Received great service and everyone was extremely friendly.,Vic & Anthony's is by far the absolute best steakhouse in Houston and certainly one of the best in the country. We've been dining there every other Saturday night for the past year or so. The steak is always cooked perfectly and the service is second to none! The restaurant is a consistent hit and a half!!,First time there...celebrating a birthday...it was a lot of fun and the food was very good.,"We have considered dining at Vidal since it opened. Now, we are sorry that we waited so long to try this undiscovered gem. We found the quality of food that we love at Tila's with the service and atmosphere that has disappeared from this old favorite of ours. It's not a spot for families with the erotic artwork and club-like feel. Kudos to the staff for a great dinner!",I was there with a party of ten and the service was on the slow side. Food was quite good. Music was a loud and interfered with easy dinner conversation.,"We went to celebrate my future mother in laws birthday... Which I clearly indicated on the open table reservation. The birthday was not ever acknowledged. Our server was Wilfred and his knowledge level of the menu, communication, and overalls service was certainly not in line with the price point of this restaurant. Although I was pleased with our menu choices, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",Service started out difficult but with another server stepping in things smoothed out. The 6 of us moved from a table to the sushi bar. Sushi Chefs Chris & Jay took fantastic care of us all. Their recommendations and combinations were exceptional! ( ...like eel and mango or spicy tuna and avocado...) The food was fresh and completely over the top. The best experience at Zushi is definitely at the sushi bar!,
