We had told them it was a birthday in the reservation but the waiter apparently never got that information. We all ordered prime rib, which we understood was their speciality. We were disappointed. It wasn't that any of the food was bad, but it was just nothing special. And my husband's full order (not the petit order) of prime rib looked just the same size as a petite order. The meat was very ordinary. The prices are certainly on the high side, so we did not feel we got good value for the money. Will try somewhere else next time for sure.",07/09/2012

The Veranda is a truly local restaurant where the food is incredible, and you get to know the owners personally. My wife and I had just landed at Houston Intercontinental and I used OpenTable to find a good restaurant. Relying on the great reviews, we decided to try the Veranda. I can honestly say that meal became one of our favorite restaurant experiences of all time. The food was among the best we have ever had. The owners, who are musical artists, also interacted with us personally and genuinely. They have had the restaurant at the same location for 16 years. Quaint and excellent. Very reasonable prices.
