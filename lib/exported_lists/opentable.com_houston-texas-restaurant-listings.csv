Currently, some of their entrees are priced and sized more like an appetizer portions. I believe that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a larger size entree portion. My feeling, however, is that they are trying to draw in a customer base that does not want to spend $$$ or $$$$ and therefore, the menu pricing and portion size are reduced.
