The new chef has simply set a new high standard. Appetizers to dessert were special. Foodies will appreciate the flavors and care this chef puts into his work. Awesome. Well worth a visit.,06/16/2012

They had some different beers on tap (Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat that I had). The owner was our server and everything was just so pleasant. It's a bit hard to find, tucked into the corner of a shopping center but if you find Raley's turn around and you'll see their sign. I'm so glad we found this place. It was nice to have something different for lunch than the typical burger and fries lunch! The owner says the place really gets hopping in the summer so it might be a fun bar scene in the middle of summer, but our spring lunch was just nice, quiet, and relaxed.",04/22/2012
