However, it would be a shame not to give this restaurant another try! Because Avanti is nearby we decided to give it another try after a couple of disappointing incidents when they first opened. This is one of the finest restaurants in this city. Several months ago I tried the Lemoncello Chicken on the menu! Since then I have returned over and over again to satisfy my craving for it. Recently I tried the Tarragon Seafood on Orzo. Shrimp, scallops, langoustine, and spinach and roma tomatoes! Now I will have a real problem deciding what to order and what to try next.

I had the bone in ribeye...she had the salmon. We had a salad and crab cake to start. All the food was great. The service was also great. My only problem with the place is the price. I wish i was a big enough high roller to eat here regualerly but im not. Even hough the food was really good....I can go somewhere like Cattlemans 3 times for the same price.

Two of us had the lobster entree, one the salmon and one the pork tenderloin with blackberry sauce. Everyone was happy! But the best was our dessert - the banana creme brulee boat. The serving dish was boat-shaped with a spun sugar sail, gorgeous and edible. The creme brulee was perfect and plenty for the four of us to share, although we may just skip the entrees next time and go straight to the boat! Good job, Palace!",07/20/2012
