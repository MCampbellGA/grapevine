Outside temp was 95 degrees and inside with every table filled, the temperature was soon unbearable. We asked the waiter if the air conditioning could be turned up but there was no noticeable difference. We left before finishing our wine as a result, and skipped desert.

Overall the food was good. Be aware that the portion sizes are more than adequate, even for the small plates. I had elk that was outstanding -- probably the best I've ever had. We had appetizers that were nice and my wife's entree was good too. On the negative side, the entrees were brought out before we had finished our appetizers. The wine we ordered was not at the right temperature - they did warn us of this to be fair and attempted to chill it, but that took awhile. I think any wine offered should be available at the proper temperature. The service was friendly. Overall, no big complaints and quality food, just not great from a service view.",07/05/2012

Really you get $20 off your bill, which is not too bad. However, the restaurant will add 20% gratuity to your bill even if you have a party of one, two, three, etc. I have an issue with this since it was just my fiance and me.

I am happy to say it was not. There are some nice, inventive items on the menu (sunflower shoot salad with tahini dressing, crispy pork belly) along side staples (great burger, regular and sweet potato fries). Even the fries have a twist, served with a honey mustard dipping sauce instead of ketchup or aioli.On our second visit, the kitchen backed up and our salads were delayed. The owner noticed this, came to our table, explained the situation, and bought our wine. Very nice! So many restaurants will explain it to you but do nothing about it. My husband liked this extra level of service!",07/14/2012

The owner/head chef was making sure all guests were seated as promptly as possible on a very busy Friday night. My wife wasn't too hungry so she opted for two appetizers, one saving as a main course. They included a squash flan and a crab cake. Both were excellent. I went with a cold white bean soup that was, without a doubt, the best chiled soup I have EVER had. The presentation was wonderful as well, as the beautiful colorful bits in the soup matched the pattern of the bowl. Fantastic. The gnocchi entree with marinara sauce was excellent too. We would go back for sure to try some other entrees and a dessert if we get back to Santa Fe again.",07/12/2012

Again, this is our favorite restaurant and it never fails to please. They were extremely busy this weekedend d/t the Folk Art Fair crowds but the service was great. We love the use of the fresh ingredients. They are also very accomodating to our little 6 y/o daughter.

The front desk informed us when we inquired that the executive chef left in the changeover, and that there is apparently an interim chef in place. The menu now is different, there were no specials, and there was no soup available! We had guests up from Albuquerque, and they were somewhat dissapointed after we had hyped the restaurant so much. Service as usual was great, but the food was not what we expected. Now, we ourselves hadn't been to Terra for several months since we were out of town, but we're on their e-mail list and there was no warning of the changeover.

My server did not ask if we wanted wine; she was too anxious to take our food order. I had to request a bottle of wine, then I had to ask for an ice bucket.
