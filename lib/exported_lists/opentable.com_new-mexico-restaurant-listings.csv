We had the duck and the lamb, followed by the creme brulee and the pots de creme, and shared all with each other. The duck and the lamb were outstanding paired together, as well as the desserts! I would actually suggest them as pairings in a single dish for the menu. We originally were going to have the beef, which was mentioned on the specials board, but were surprised to learn upon requesting it to the waitstaff, that it would take 40 minutes to prepare, even rare, which is our preference.
