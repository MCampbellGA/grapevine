We dined in the formal dining area, but next time will probably just sit in the wine bar area. We used a gift certificate which had been mangled by our new puppy and was still graciously accepted. We will definitely go back, but stick to the less expensive wine bar menu, which really seemed to be more our style. However, the food was excellent, service was fantastic, and we very much enjoyed ourselves!",07/17/2012
