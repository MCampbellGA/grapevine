Janell was our server and she was wonderful. If you are going for a romantic night out, get there early. It fills up fast and can get very loud as it's a small restaurant.

The setting was great. We were able to sit side by side. It was our 15th anniversary. We each ordered the specials....her a lobster tail and steak, my self a steak with bone in. Both were ordered medium rare. Mine came in more on the rare side....purple at the bone and they had to take it back to cook it a little more...came back just right. The fries that came with ""surf & turf"" we one th cold and tuff side but still accented them meal nicely. The cooked tomatoe that came with my steak was also nicely done. I would say the meal was a little pricey for what we got as it comes with little to no accessories or sides. Looks pretty small on such a big, hot plate. Again the service was perfect.",07/12/2012

Good food, outstanding service and fine atmosphere. While we desired to dine outdoors the 100 plus degree temperature would have made it a long time.

Friendly service, delicious dessert (warm butter cake).The Vault salad was SO good...and I loved the way the burger my daughter got was served, on a plank/cutting board.

Made the reservation through open table and we were seated immediately, but at the tiniest table imaginable for dinner service. There really was no room for feet under this table so one of mine protruded out a bit and got stepped on twice by busy waiters. Cocktails were good. We ordered the appetizer of Grilled Kale Salad and it was excellent. Husband got the sturgeon which was dry and tasteless. I ordered the half roasted chicken and I have no particular criticism, but certainly not a dish I would order again. Now the very bad news: service was very slow. We were seated at 7:15, our order was taken within about 5 minutes. Appetizer arrived about 30 minutes later and the entrees were served at 8:40! Ridiculous!",07/13/2012
