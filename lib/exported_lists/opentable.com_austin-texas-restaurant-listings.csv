They had a range of sushi selections that I even had trouble in making a decision on what to eat. My significant other and I went for dinner on a Wednesday, even though it was week days the restaurant seemed busy. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu which it can be very helpful when there’re so many good choices to choose from. Everything that I flavor from the menu I was very satisfy and this is coming from a female who’s very finicky about her eating habits.

We only saw our server twice, but when she brought us the check, she was friendly as can be. It took 45 minutes to get our food and we got it before people who were there far before we were. It seemed as though the staff and kitchen couldnt handle the magnitude of service that was there. You should probably get an entire new crew. I went down to the concierge, who was probably the friendliest person I came across. Kudos to her. She was the only person who made us feel welcome in the entire place.",07/04/2012

This, our second time, it was the polar opposite experience. The service was really terrible. The food was good (better than most places), but even it fell flat compared to the first time. We sat for over 5 minutes before we had a server greet us to ask for drinks. We waited another 10 min for those drinks (water, sprite). We waited 30 minutes for our appetizer (Crispy Pork Belly), and *another* 30 minutes (over an hour total) to *get* our entrees. We never got offered bread, until I saw another table get the bread and I asked *another* server for some. Overall, left a lot to be desired. Very disappointing.",07/19/2012
