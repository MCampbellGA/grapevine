She happens to live in Keller and we were able to have a fine discussion about schools in Keller and Flower Mound as we live there. The food was very good. I would have chosen a steak instead of the shrimp that I ordered. The shrimp was rather ordinary. My husband ordered the salmon and our daughter had crab legs and both were excellent. The lobster bisque soup was wonderful! We waited a bit for our entrees but this was fine for us as we had more time to let the food digest.

When we arrived for our reservation they were very kind, the manager was up front and greeted us, and we decided to go up to the bar since we were early. They have some fun cocktail selections and appetizers that we tried. Then for dinner, the ambiance is really nice downstairs (modern hip which is hard to find in Grapevine) and the service was great. The garlic bread was reallyyy yummy and we had a nice steak. Only complaint was the cheese used in the mac and cheese side wasn't our favorite, but that's personal taste.
