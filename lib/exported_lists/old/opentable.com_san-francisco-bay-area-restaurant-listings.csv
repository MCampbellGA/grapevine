In it's early years, it was a destination restaurant and always busy. The original chef must have moved on and the food shows lack of focus now. While our meal was 'OK/Good', there is no more 'wow' factor. 2 of us ordered the grilled Sea Bass which came on the dry side for both of us and to me, tasted like Halibut. It had a good flavor but was lacking in sauce to make up for the dryness. The accompaning beans were overcooked as well. The dish was just not bad enough to send it back. Our other dining partner had the Stroganoff and like us, she stated that the pasta was too al-dente and stuck together. These are signs of lack of focus as this was a Friday night and not crowded.",07/20/2012
