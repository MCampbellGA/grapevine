Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He did not hesitate to pick the perfect glass of wine to pair with our meals. I ordered the day boat sea scallops and my husband ordered the hanger steak. Both were excellent, with the exception that my husband ordered his steak cooked medium well, which made the steak a little less than perfect. At the end they presented my husband a absolutely scrumptious brownie with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel for his birthday. My husband enjoyed every moment. We will be back.",07/20/2012

Fried Calamari for appetizer; portion size was WAY too small for the price. Ordered 2 glasses of wine, one was maybe a 6 oz pour and other was more like 4 oz. Way too much stuff on the menu (almost always never a good sign at a restaurant). Lasagne and pizza were good; spaghetti puttanesca was ok (not bad but not great either); veal scallopini was literally inedible and a very small portion for the price, probably one of the worst things I've ever tasted in a restaurant. Sides were very mediocre - small salad with gelatinous Italian dressing, very small portion of veggies and pasta with veal. Waitress was scattered, lasagne arrived 10 mins after rest of food. Should have had a better experience for $100.",07/19/2012
