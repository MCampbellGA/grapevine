We were greeted warmly by staff and promptly seated. We both ordered the Braised Colorado Sirloin, served on a bed of lentils and drizzled with tzatziki. The lamb was fork-tender. The lamb and lentils were flavored with cinnamon and a spicy curry. We ordered side dishes of grilled asparagus and Potatoes Delmonico. The asparagus was tender, sweet and cooked to just the right degree of done-ness, and drizzled with olive oil and flavored with a hint of nutmeg. Wonderful! For dessert we shared Lavender Blueberry Cobbler. This takes about 20 minutes to prepare, so I advise you order early. It was served up piping hot and was wonderful!",04/01/2012
