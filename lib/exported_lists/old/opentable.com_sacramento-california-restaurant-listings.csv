The first two visits were more positive experiences. The service was fine but the food was just average for me. Let's just say that not one of the 12 people that ate there gave me any feedback whatsoever. I ordered the fish and chips and regretted it right after I saw it. The fish looked like a fast food fry and was absolutely tasteless. Fries were just average, nothing special. I did not finish the meal as it was too bland. My co-worker ordered a very nice spinach salad but his black bean soup was delvered cold. it took the waiter about 10-15 minutes to come back to the table to even notice it.
