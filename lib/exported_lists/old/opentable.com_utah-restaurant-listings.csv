First, my father's ""custom salad"" (arugula rather than mixed greens) was an expensive 3 bites. The amuse bouche they brought unexpectedly before dinner was also on the bill (not expensive) but, really? Lastly, at the beginning of the meal when my mom was selecting wines she saw a brunello she wanted to order, but realizing the price was for a 1/2 she went for a less expensive full bottle. At the end of dinner when my brother wanted to order more wine and essentially left it up to our waitress she took liberty of ordering the same 1/2 brunello that was too expensive, also knowing the %20 tip was already included.",07/20/2012

I spend a lot of money here. It's one of the few places I'm willing to eat sushi in Utah. I've been a customer for a long time. I have used open table checks and VIP rewards over and over. Most of the staff is great too! If I had one complaint about this restaurant it is that they do not greet me by name. I'm a regular and have been for a few years. You'd figure the staff would figure out your name after scanning your VIP and credit cards so many times.

Unfortunately our experience went downhill quickly from there. We waited almost 20 minutes before being greeted by our server and then didn't receive our drinks until 40 minutes after being seated. Our appetizers finally came after we had been there for over an hour. The food was fine but I've had similar dishes at other restaurants around town that I've enjoyed much more than at this restaurant. I'd read the menu online before making our reservation and it just looked like the kind of restaurant I would enjoy so I was really excited to dine here but found it to be very underwhelming.
