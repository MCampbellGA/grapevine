I've been to ALC before, but it had been awhile. I was surprised at how much the building has deteriorated, & there was a distinct ""old house"" smell - slightly mildewy. We were seated (in a mostly empty restaurant) right by the kitchen entrance. Okay, I guess, until right after we got our appetizer we were overpowered with what smelled like wintergreen dip. Air freshener to mask the mildew smell? Cleaning solution? We asked to move tables & were accommodated (with only a slight eye roll). New table was better, food was good (though I wasn't crazy about the steak rub). Service was fair - our waiter kind of forgot about us after our entrees came.

My husband and I each had different salads and different entrees (sharing a side and dessert), and we were both ecstatic with our selections. The portions aren't the three-meals in one you sometimes get at Italian restaurants, but they aren't the 2-ounces-of-food-with-parsley you get at other restaurants of this quality, either. I was full without the dessert and side, but I ate them anyway (they were delicious!). It was not overpriced for the quality or the size, but ordering a lot of food will add up (2 entrees, 2 salads, 1 wine, 1 side, and 1 dessert ran us about $85).

Then my only other choice for steak were $80 and $65. I'm sure they were probably great choices, but a little pricey for my budget. I ended up going with the ""off the menu"" choice of sea scallopes.
