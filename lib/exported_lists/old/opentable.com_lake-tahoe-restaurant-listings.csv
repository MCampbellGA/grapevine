Charlie Palmer Steak is a formidable effort for fine dining. The food was mostly good; our halibut dish was a bit dry / over-seared and the sauce was scant. The seafood platter was tasty, but again, a bit light for the price. As a food lover from the Bay Area – a wonderful mecca of fresh, organic, progressive dining options – my hopes were that this would hit near the mark I am accustomed to. I can say that this was some of the better dining I experienced in Reno. The service, while friendly, was a bit overbearing and could have been more perceptive about our needs for table conversation.
