Double Nickel Steak House,http://www.opentable.com/double-nickel-steak-house?scpref=109&tab=2,4.5,"5405 Slide Road Lubbock, TX  79414 ",2,Steakhouse,$30 and under,Lubbock,http://www.doublenickelsteakhouse.com/,doublenickelsteaks@gmail.com,(806) 792-0055,4 / 5,"For a place that hypes itself one of the best ""independent"" steakhouses, it has a long way to go. Its closer to the quality level of a chain place like Outback. In a bigger city with more high-end choices, it wouldn't survive (my wife and I don't live in Lubbock). True greatness shows in the details. Our menus both had different choices/prices. Waiter was switched. Salads drowned in dressing. Bread never came without multiple reminders. Sauteed mushrooms tasted sour. The steaks, fortunately, were very good but not served with advertised accompaniments, but a huge lump of bland julienned vegetables instead. Maybe they were off their game on this Wednesday night. Or maybe they aren't truly great. Neither is an acceptable outcome for my money.",12/21/2011

The waiter offered very little in the way of California Chardonnay to go with my delicious chicken pasta with prosciutto and peas. The sommelier happened to walk by and I asked if he had a reasonably priced CA chard. He offered me a nice Piedmont selection. Had he not happened by, I wouldn't have had a nice accompaniment to my dish. The house made balsamic viniagrette was good, but the greens were nothing to write about as they were straight out of the bag with only a couple of grape tomatoes and a little chopped olive.",06/12/2012
Pecan Grill,http://www.opentable.com/pecan-grill?scpref=109&tab=2,4.0,"2322 Mac Davis Drive Lubbock, TX  79401 ",1,American,$30 and under,Lubbock,http://www.overtonhotel.com/pecan-grill.html,bruceadamson@overtonhotel.com,(806) 776-7010,4 / 5,"Our visit to Pecan Grill was marred by a couple of miscues by the staff. First, a waiter spilled a glass of iced tea on us, good thing it wasn't red wine. Second, the Open Table reservation was never input into the system, so we received an email asking why we never showed up. In retrospect, the spilled tea was a good thing, as it gave us an event that the management remembered and they cleared up our points.",04/21/2012

There really wasn't one thing that was outstanding or even excellent that stood out. Service was good for the amount of people that nearly packed the restaurant at 7 p.m., and when the JJJ is packed, its very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation. I've had better meals here, and the place seems to be succeeding on reputation, not quality or innovation.",04/17/2012
