We were able to sit side by side. It was our 15th anniversary. We each ordered the specials....her a lobster tail and steak, my self a steak with bone in. Both were ordered medium rare. Mine came in more on the rare side....purple at the bone and they had to take it back to cook it a little more...came back just right. The fries that came with ""surf & turf"" we one th cold and tuff side but still accented them meal nicely. The cooked tomatoe that came with my steak was also nicely done. I would say the meal was a little pricey for what we got as it comes with little to no accessories or sides. Looks pretty small on such a big, hot plate. Again the service was perfect.",07/12/2012

The atmosphere was sufficient for enjoyment; the staff was very friendly and helpful. Although the menu selections were descriptive and enticing, the food was fair in flavor. Perhaps is was only our selections. What was unfair was the price of a plain ole name brand scotch at $9.50. Having worked in the restaurant business in earlier years, no reputation could substantiate charging 1/3 the bottle price for a single drink. We would only consider stopping by again for a brunch or lunch to indulge in a salad if there is a next time. Thank you.",07/21/2012
