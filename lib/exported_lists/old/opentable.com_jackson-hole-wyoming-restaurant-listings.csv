Service was the outstanding memory and our waiter was very knowledgable about the wines he poured. Yes the view was wonderful, but once the sun has set, there are not enough lights on the mountain and valley to make it spectacular. The interior lighting is too bright and the huge windows become mostly black mirrors. The interior design is on the cheap side of the spectrum. What you go there for is the view.",07/12/2012

Although none of us wanted more than a burger, they were excellent including a portabella mushroom burger. Great martini to boot! Service was solid and the friendly manager even dropped by to see how things went for us. The place had a good buzz on a Thursday night and the ambience is nice. I can see how it might get a little rowdy when packed as the concrete floor will reflect noise upward with little to stop it. But for us, there were no noise issues. Portions are ample as well.

The service was excellent and the atmosphere was lively, but with the exception of the bison burger (which was delicious) the food was flat or just outright bad. Our salad starters were just ok and the flank was below average. The accompanying brussel sprouts were inedible. To the Q's credit, the chef recolonized his gaff on the vegetables and offered us a glass of wine as compensation. Because of its convenient location and quality customer service, we will likely give Q another chance",07/14/2012
