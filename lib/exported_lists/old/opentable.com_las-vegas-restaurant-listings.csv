The only issue some people may have is some of the tables are open to the concourse, where hotel guests pass by. The noise wasn't bothersome but you do sacrifice privacy.

The sides are called an entree, yet will feed 4 a good portion size. The crab cake appetizer, well our crew adores, huge chunks of crab, no filler! Really awesome ambiance, just a wonderful evening out. We always plan dinner, then walk on out to Freemont to walk dinner off a bit as just know we will overeat. The steaks are superb and no steak sauce will be needed for taste! Enjoy",06/25/2012
Vino's Ristorante - Cannery Casino & Hotel,4.3,"2121 East Craig Rd Las Vegas, NV  89030 ",67,Italian,$30 and under,Las Vegas,http://www.cannerycasinos.com,"",(702) 507-5777,4.2 / 5,"I selected Vino because of the location and the fact that I had an OpenTable dining check. The introductory service was substandard as our drink order was not taken until about 10 minutes after we got there...mind u there were only 4 occupied tables. A table that was seated after us by at least a few minutes was attended to first and I don't believe the server ever introduced herself by name and definitely didn't mention any specials or suggestions. I was even more shocked during the delivery of the food, as I am a person that loves fresh grated parm and the server expressed her annoyance with it. Then when the check came it took the staff approximately 20 minutes to process the rewards check after we had already boxed our food.",07/15/2012

I had the Short Ribs which I'd recommend. The restaurant design/decor was nice, but the service was poor. The initial greeting was horrible. The hostess glared at us when we arrived and seemed put out she had to show us to seats. The waiter was okay, but very unattentive. We waited a long time for him to get our drinks order, in the end we went to the bar ourselves. It wasn't a bad evening despite that, but not a place I'd bother going back to.
