Finally we were seated and informed that the hostess was M.I.A. Shortly the hostess arrived and took our order for a plate of crab cakes and a seafood louie for each of us. Bread was served partly frozen. The crabcakes were mostly cake with a hint of crab. The louies were crab with bits of shell, overcooked salmon & 2 unshelled shrimp piled on large lettuce leafs & a side of dressing. After eating the crabcakes, the silverware & bread were taken away before serving the ""louies"" forks came later. Desert was icecream which was very good.",07/19/2012

The cheese plate was great. I especially loved the truffle sea stack(sp?). The food took over an hour to arrive. When delivered, they got the tables mixed. My arugula salad was good.

It was hard to find something appealing, especially by the glass. I would suggest more Washington syrahs, cabernet sauvignons and red blends. I would add a couple sauvignon blancs from New Zealand—since they do them better than almost anyone—and a seasonal rose wine from Provence.

I've had several dinners there with both excellent food and service. I was excited to take a friend there for lunch recently; expecting the same high standards of service. However, I couldn't have been more dissapointed. The service was disorganized and forgetful - I never ended up getting the drink I ordered at the beginning of my meal, and my original waiter never came back to the table. Our glasses remained empty during the meal and it took a long time to flag anyone down to even bring more water. The food was not up to the Georgian's high dinner standards either - portions were very small for the price and even the clam chowder was bland. Only worth going for dinner.",07/08/2012
