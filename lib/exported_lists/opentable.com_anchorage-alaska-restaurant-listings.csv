Lots of seafood and perfectly spiced with a bit of bite. My wife ordered the Fruit and Nut Salad in the entree size, and immediately said it was lifeless. I tried it as well and agreed, totally lethargic. While it was supposed to be finished with a blueberry brandy vinaigrette, any hint of dressing was barely detectable. Maybe this was geared toward the summer geriatric tourists, and that is fine, but other diners should be warned. I ordered Wild Mushroom Fettuccine, and while it was good, the fettuccine itself was overcooked. Great atmosphere and live music. And the service is outstanding. Next time, double down on the seafood chowder.",07/06/2012

This time, this first time ever, we were quite dissapointed. The service was great, it was the food that was a huge letdown. My salad had wilted brown lettuce, was haphazardly prepared.
