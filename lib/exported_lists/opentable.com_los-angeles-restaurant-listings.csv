But I don't think I'll go back to Street and I wouldn't recommend it to others. They take the concept of small plates to an insane degree. The plates were tiny. We were a group of four and the waiter recommended four people should split 8-12 dishes. We ordered 9 and it didn't come close to being enough. I'd say a group of four needs more like 16-24 dishes. We went to a concert after dinner and all I could think about was stopping at a drive-thru on the way home!

Especially for the price. Although we were right on time for a 7:00 reservation, we were not seated until 7:20. We never quite understood what we had been waiting for. And instead of showing us to the bar while we waited, the hostess had us sit on 4 wire chairs next to the hostess area (which is a bland, stark area.) We walked through the bar to be seated and were baffled why she had not suggested we wait there.Clearly we paid for the view (astonishing) and the extra special ""attention"" from a variety of wait staff. But Id rather pay a little less and just enjoy tremendous food.",09/25/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/wp24-by-wolfgang-puck,wp24-by-wolfgang-puck

The patio is a nice place to sit.The bad: inside is a bit shabby & dark, the menu is a bit too big, the food is clearly based on canned & packaged ingredients. The clam chowder seemed clearly not to be freshly made (my guess is they use a canned/frozen or packaged base of some sort), the pasta mediocre, presentation/plating poor. The worst part, however, was the service. The wait person/hostess was inattentive & brought our entire meal at the same time.
