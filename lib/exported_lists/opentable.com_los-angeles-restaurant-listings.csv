I first saw a promo offer on Gilt City, then I was amazed by the hotel and restaurant decor. I was very lucky that the restaurant provided us the private dining room, which is really an awesome experience. However, I was disappointed by the food as whether it's Lamb Chops or Seared Wagyu, they all tasted a bit too salty. Although I do have to say that the Dog Point Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough 2008 was fantastic, never had a such a memorable Sauvignon Blanc, and it made me want to just to keep a bottle at home. Didn't really get a chance to taste the dessert as I was too busy talking to peeps. I probably won't go back for the dinner.",07/14/2012

I think mainly because it wasn't particularly warm, I knocked a couple of stars off the food. Also, the place is in need of a rehaul. The '70s architecture and theme were great for everyone, but the '70s was the '70s and I'm sorry, but as disco and cocaine are out, so should be the decor. But since I never was into disco or cocaine, and I have young kids who love airplanes (okay, me too), this was a great place for them to watch incoming flights into LAX and for me to see some really cool old planes. I got some great photos also, if that is what you're into. Kids had a great time and because that is all I care about, overall this is a 4-star restaurant. Thanks.",07/21/2012

They have a great idea but terrible management which every waiter, host, and bus boy let us know every chance they got. Ultimately we paid over $200+inforced 18%gratuity to watch people heavily smoke hookah around screaming kids while we shoveled food off unsteady ottomans (they used as tables) as they indirectly kicked us out but not before hearing every complaint from the staff. Also they illegally used the only open parking spaces for thier valet. I'm positive there are better things to spend money on than this place. I wish I could send a personal message to the owners cuz this place deserves a slap in the face.",05/11/2012

It was a beautiful evening and it is very nice to sit outside. That area was improved upon.That being said, the dinner was the worst I have ever had there or at any Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles.To be brief, everything came cold.....The chicken cashew was overdone -- it had obviously been sitting around all day.The shrimp (honey walnut ) had no taste, no glaze, infact the shrimp tasted medicinal. Thebuddha's feast which at one time would be ample for 4 people, was barely enough for 2. Again, it was obviously not preparedwhile we were there. Mushu was again, underwhelming. The wrapper was hard so it was not cooked properly. Less food, highercosts, poor preparation. Never",07/12/2012
