We were seated straight away, and made our food/drink choices. There were four people in our party and two chose the 8oz mignon steak, and two chose the 16oz New York steak. We were advised there would be a 45 minute wait for our steaks, but the time flew by. We were given a bread basket, followed by a complimentary salmon taster and ceasar salad. The steaks arrived and the verdict from all parties was that the steaks were the best ever tasted. Whilst they were cooked 'well done', the meat was such good quality, they just melted in the mouth! The meal for four was quite pricey, but well worth it!

Also had our regular bolognese which is loaded with meat sauce and always great. Breadsticks at the beginning are addictive.
