I had the Short Ribs which I'd recommend. The restaurant design/decor was nice, but the service was poor. The initial greeting was horrible. The hostess glared at us when we arrived and seemed put out she had to show us to seats. The waiter was okay, but very unattentive. We waited a long time for him to get our drinks order, in the end we went to the bar ourselves. It wasn't a bad evening despite that, but not a place I'd bother going back to. Too many other great Mexican places in Vegas.",06/27/2012
