We then ordered another round of drinks, which came at a medium pace. The food was amazing, and we were then comped a Watermelon Cucumber Sorbet that was the best we'd ever had.

It was super busy, as always, and the food and service were good but not as outstanding as we have come to expect there. The waiter was a little slow and annoyingly referred to our group and himself as ""us"" repeatedly. The food did not all arrive at the same time, and the manager gave us a free drink to make up for it. WCG is one of those rare places where service is ""team"" service and it does not matter who your waiter is because everyone working there does whatever needs to be done. That system is awesome when it works, which it usually does. Our recent experience was good, not great. Our waiter was a nice kid, but either inexperienced or overworked.",07/13/2012

Our head server was somewhat unfriendly and seemed impatient, but the assistant servers made up for it. We started with the terrine (foie gras), which was very tasty, and the lobster bisque, which we found overly salty and bland with no depth of flavor. It seemed like a lot of tables were ordering it, and it looked gorgeous with the golden puff pastry on top, but alas, not a winner. I had the beef wellington--fantastic and the star of the night, while my husband ordered the lamb rack. He thought it was cooked well, but didn't have as much seasoning as he would have liked. Wright's kindly gave us a complimentary chocolate souffle for dessert. Delicious.",07/07/2012

As we were about to take our first bites into them, our main meals arrived. The up side? We didn't fill up on scones before our meal. I had also mentioned my daughters birthday on the Open Table reservation, which the restaurant acknowledged when they called to confirm the reservation. They then forgot about it when we were there. I shouldn't really complain since I forgot to mention it too. Everything was very good and proportioned just right. The Ho'Js were awesome!! Orange creamsicle in a glass!!",05/13/2012
