Our head server was somewhat unfriendly and seemed impatient, but the assistant servers made up for it. We started with the terrine (foie gras), which was very tasty, and the lobster bisque, which we found overly salty and bland with no depth of flavor. It seemed like a lot of tables were ordering it, and it looked gorgeous with the golden puff pastry on top, but alas, not a winner. I had the beef wellington--fantastic and the star of the night, while my husband ordered the lamb rack. He thought it was cooked well, but didn't have as much seasoning as he would have liked. Wright's kindly gave us a complimentary chocolate souffle for dessert. Delicious.",07/07/2012

I had also mentioned my daughters birthday on the Open Table reservation, which the restaurant acknowledged when they called to confirm the reservation. They then forgot about it when we were there. I shouldn't really complain since I forgot to mention it too. Everything was very good and proportioned just right. The Ho'Js were awesome!! Orange creamsicle in a glass!!",05/13/2012
