Dinner at Zero Zero this week was the best meal experience I have had since I can remember! The cocktail list is amazing, and I took the server's recommendation for the top one on the list. It was some gin, basil delicious-ness and I could not have been more pleased! I had three :). For dinner, I had the Castro Pizza and it too was the best thing to touch my lips in quite some time. The thin crust was perfectly crisp, and despite having sopressata and sausage, the pizza was not at all greasy.
