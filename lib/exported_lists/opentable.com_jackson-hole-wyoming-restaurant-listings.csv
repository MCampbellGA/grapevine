We'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months. The facility is stunning, at the base of Snow King, with beautiful views. The service was decent and the wine list was okay.

Service was the outstanding memory and our waiter was very knowledgable about the wines he poured. Yes the view was wonderful, but once the sun has set, there are not enough lights on the mountain and valley to make it spectacular. The interior lighting is too bright and the huge windows become mostly black mirrors. The interior design is on the cheap side of the spectrum. What you go there for is the view.",07/12/2012

The onion ring appetizer is fantastic...crispy, seasoned batter and enough for four people to split. Although none of us wanted more than a burger, they were excellent including a portabella mushroom burger. Great martini to boot! Service was solid and the friendly manager even dropped by to see how things went for us. The place had a good buzz on a Thursday night and the ambience is nice. I can see how it might get a little rowdy when packed as the concrete floor will reflect noise upward with little to stop it. But for us, there were no noise issues. Portions are ample as well.

Both the elk tenderloin and bison were good but sides were lack luster. Menu is very pricey for less than innovative dishes. Serves and view were great. Not overly impressed with food. Worth a visit for just the view - maybe best for just drinks.,07/16/2012

It is a great place to dine for those with homes or anyone staying north of town. The view of the Tetons over the golf course is beautiful. Although the kitchen can be sluggish, the food is good and worth the wait and the waitstaff are very helpful and friendly.

The service was excellent and the atmosphere was lively, but with the exception of the bison burger (which was delicious) the food was flat or just outright bad. Our salad starters were just ok and the flank was below average. The accompanying brussel sprouts were inedible. To the Q's credit, the chef recolonized his gaff on the vegetables and offered us a glass of wine as compensation. Because of its convenient location and quality customer service, we will likely give Q another chance",07/14/2012

The bread was excellent. The wine list had an extensive selection and reasonable pricing. The food was not particularly pleasing. It seems as if the chef tried to do too much with too many ingredients and left a bit of a cacophony of flavors in the appetizers and main courses we tried. The food was not bad, just a bit confusing on the palate. Overall, it was a pleasant experience due to the very friendly and attentive staff. Maybe just a bad night for the kitchen?",02/18/2012

My wife's filet mignon was well done and she ordered medium. The restaurant was almost empty and there are valid reasons why. Obviously, this restaurant relies on people staying at the hotel to eat at the restaurant instead of just putting out good food. The outlandish price was laughable.",05/12/2012
